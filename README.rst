Volatility Prediction for Financial Markets
==============


    The goal of this project is to develop models that forecast short-term volatility across a diverse set of stocks, spanning different sectors. These predictions are made over 10-minute intervals, using a large dataset of historical market data. Accurate volatility forecasting can significantly improve pricing models for financial products such as options, ETFs, cash equities, bonds, and foreign currencies.



This repository contains code and resources for building models to predict short-term volatility in financial markets. Volatility refers to the degree of variation in the price of a financial instrument over time, and predicting it accurately is crucial for trading strategies, particularly in options markets. High volatility indicates turbulent periods with large price swings, while low volatility suggests calmer, more stable market conditions.

Features of the Project
====

- Granular Financial Data: The dataset includes hundreds of millions of rows of detailed market data.
- Short-term Predictions: The focus is on predicting volatility over brief, 10-minute periods to assist with real-time trading decisions.
- Cross-Sector Analysis: Models are trained and evaluated on stocks from a variety of sectors, ensuring robustness and generalizability across different market conditions.

Methodology
====

The project relies on advanced data science techniques, using features extracted from high-frequency financial data. Machine learning models are trained to forecast volatility, and these predictions are compared against real market data collected during an evaluation period.

Goals
====

By developing accurate volatility prediction models, this project aims to:

- Improve pricing algorithms for a variety of financial products
- Gain deeper insights into market dynamics and structure
- Contribute to better decision-making in real-time trading environments
- We are excited to explore different approaches and continue refining these models to adapt to evolving market conditions.

Getting Started
====

To get started, clone the repository and follow the instructions in the setup file to install the necessary dependencies. The core scripts for model training, evaluation, and data processing are included, along with a detailed notebook that walks through the modeling approach.
